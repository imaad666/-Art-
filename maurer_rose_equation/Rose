this is a simplistic display of the maurer rose equation 


in this equation:
Let r = sin(nÎ¸) be a rose in the polar coordinate system, where n is a positive integer. 
The rose has n petals if n is odd, and 2n petals if n is even.

We then take 361 points on the rose:

(sin(nk), k) (k = 0, d, 2d, 3d, ..., 360d),
where d is a positive integer and the angles are in degrees, not radians.
